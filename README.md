wddroidy is a small conversion script to convert a Wikidata SPARQL result into
a DROID compatible signature file.

## Why?

If we are ever to be able to use Wikibase as a platform for file forrmat
information then we need to be able to handle the different serializations of
file format signature.

Previous work on Siegfried already extracts Wikidata information and processes
it into something useful. It is only a small leap to use the same data for
DROID's purposes which we do here.

FIDO may also be able to use this output but it may require a little further
effort.
